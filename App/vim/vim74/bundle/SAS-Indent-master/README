Indent script for SAS. The algorithm is supposed to be rather tolerable.

Examples of the indenting results are shown as following:

1. For data section and procedure, proper indenting would be applied, with or without closing the section by run/quit statement.

   data female;
         set total; where gender = 0;
   data male;
         set total; where gender = 1;
   run;
   
   data new;
         set female male;
   run;

   proc sort data = new;
         by gender;
   proc freq data = new;
         table gender / missing;
   endsas;

2. Even mixed with macro, the indenting is correct.

   %macro temp();
         data new;
               where age >= 18;
               format gender gender.;
         proc freq data = new;
               table gender / missing;
   %mend; * Without closing by run statement;

3. Logic expressions.

   data a;
         set b; where age >= 18;
         if numtx = 1 and not (pid > 0 and dcitag in (1, 2)) then strata = 3;
         else if pid > 0 then do;
               if dcitag in (1, 2) then do; 
                     strata = 1; dcitype = 1;
               end;
               else if dcipsh1 = 1 then do;
                     strata = 1; dcitype = 3;
               end;
               else if numtx > 1 then strata = 2;
         end;
         else do;
               if dcitag2 in (1, 2) then do; 
                     strata = 1; dcitype = 2;
               end;
               else if dcipsh1 = 1 then do;
                     strata = 1; dcitype = 3;
               end;
               else if pid < 0 and dcipsh1 ~= 1 and numtx > 1 then strata = 2;
         end;
   run;       

PS: It should also work very well with my SAS syntax file: http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=3522
